        <p>Among the 250 species of turtleon the Earth,seven of them live in the Ocean(called sea turtles),and 243
            species live on land (terrestrial turtles called tortoises) or freshwater ponds and marshes.Five of the
            seven species
            of the sea turtles the green turtles,Hawksbill turtles,Olive Ridley,Loggerhead and leatherback visit the
            SriLankan
            shores to nest.Three species of freshwater turtles-Parker's Black turtle,sriLankan Black<br> Turtle and the
            Soft
            or Flapshell
            Turtles and one terrestrial tortoise,the Star tortoise,can also be found in Srilanka.

                            <p>This critically endangered turtle is the largest of the 5 species and is a rare find in
                                Sri Lanka. It remains on the brink of extinction.

                                It is easily identifiable due to its long front flippers and unique black and white
                                stripy shell - its carapace is in fact a layer of thin, tough, rubbery skin peppered
                                with thousands of bone plates giving it a leathery appearance. It is in fact the only
                                sea turtle that lacks a hard shell!

                                In addition, they have a unique blood circulatory system for a cold-blooded reptile
                                which means they are able to keep their blood warm even in cold waters using metabolic
                                heat from their muscle activity.

                                The Leatherback reaches a maximum length of 3m and a weight of 750kg. Their unique
                                flexible carapace and its seven ridges enable them to dive to depths of 1500m in search
                                of their favourite food, the jellyfish!

                                Around 5 Leatherback Turtles are known to nest at Kosgoda Beach each year.</p>

                                The smallest of the sea turtles and one of the two species of ridley turtle, the Olive
                                Ridley reaches a maximum size of 65cm and weighs 35-45kg. It is named after its
                                olive/rust coloured shell.

                                Olive Ridley Turtles nest yearly, and many lay their eggs on Kosgoda Beach, depositing
                                more than 150 at one time. They are omnivores, eating crustaceans, fish and some marine

                                The Hawksbill gets its English name from its narrow head and bird-like beak, which is
                                used to catch animals hiding in small crevices. It is a regular visitor to Sri Lanka and
                                other tropical and subtropical waters. Although one of the smaller species of sea
                                turtle, it is renowned for its beautiful shell, which is made up of 13 symmetrical
                                pieces and is very colourful.</p>

                            <p>Loggerhead turtles have large heads with powerful jaws. The top shell (carapace) is
                                slightly heart-shaped and reddish-brown in adults and sub-adults, while the bottom shell
                                (plastron) is generally a pale yellowish color.Loggerhead turtles, like all sea turtles,
                                are marine reptiles and must come to the surface to breathe air. Adult female sea
                                turtles return to land to lay their eggs in the sandâ€”they are remarkable navigators and
                                usually return to a beach in the general area where they hatched decades earlier.</p>

                                the loggerhead turtle's range extends from Newfoundland to Argentina. In the eastern
