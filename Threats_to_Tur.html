                <h1>Ocean Pollution /Marine Debris</h1>
                <p>Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each
                    year due to plastic debris in the ocean. More than 80% of this plastic comes from land. It washes
                    out from our beaches and streets. It travels through storm drains into streams and rivers. It flies
                    away from landfills into our seas. As a result, thousands of sea turtles accidentally swallow these
                    plastics, mistaking them for food. Leatherbacks especially, cannot distinguish between floating
                    jellyfish a main component of their diet and floating plastic bags. Most of the debris is
                    recognizable: plastic bags, balloons, bottles, degraded buoys, plastic packaging, and food wrappers.
                    Some plastics aren't so easy to see, so small, in fact, that it is invisible to the naked eye.</p>

                <h1>Commercial Fishing</h1>
                <p>Each year hundreds of thousands of adult and immature sea turtles are accidentally captured in
                    fisheries ranging from highly mechanized operations to small-scale fishermen around the world.
                    Global estimates of annual capture, injury and mortality are staggering 150,000 turtles of all
                    species killed in shrimp trawls, more than 200,000 loggerheads and 50,000 leatherbacks captured,
                    injured or killed by longlines, and large numbers of all species drowned in gill nets. The extent of
                    gill net mortality is unknown, but sea turtle capture is significant where studied, and the drowning
                    of sea turtles in gill nets may be comparable to trawl and longline mortality. Deaths in gill nets
                    are particularly hard to quantify because these nets are set by uncounted numbers of local fishermen
                    in tropical waters around the world.</p>

                <h1>Climate Change</h1>
                <p> For all sea turtle,warming climate likely to result in change beach morpology higher sand
                    temperatue, which can be lethal to
                    eggs or alter the ratio male and female hatchings produced.
                    Because sea turtles use both marine and terrestrial habits during their life cycles, the affects of
                    climate change are likely to have a devastating impact on these endangered species. Climate change
                    affects nesting beaches. With melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels, beaches are starting to
                    disappear. As the water level begins to rise, the size of nesting beaches decrease. Stronger storms,
                    predicted as a result of increasing temperatures, will continue to erode coastal habitats. Higher
                    temperatures can adversely affect sea turtle gender ratio.</p>

                <h1>Direct Harvest of Turtles & Eggs</h1>
                <p>Historically,turtle were killed extraordinary hidh numbers for their fat,meat and eggs.This led to
                    the catastropic
                    global decline of the species.While illegal in United States,killing turtle and collecting their

                    remains legal in some countries and this can distrupt regional efforts to recover this turtles.</p>

                <p>Become a conscious and responsible seafood consumer by asking where and how your seafood was caught.
                    Choose seafood caught in ways that do not harm or kill turtles. Consult sustainable seafood
                    information networks to learn about how and where your seafood is caught.</p>

                        Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.Participate in
                        coastal

                        Trash in
                        the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.</li>
                    <li>Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags</li>
                    <li>Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can
                        mistake them
                        for prey and consume them.</li>
                    <li>Keep nesting beaches dark and safe for sea turtles. Turn off, shield, or redirect lights visible
                        from
                        the beach. Lights disorient hatchling sea turtles and discourage nesting females from coming
                        onto the
                        beach to lay their eggs.</li>
                    <li>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organized sea turtle watches that
                        know how
                        to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</li>
                    <li>Remove recreational beach equipment like chairs, umbrellas, boats at night so sea turtles are
                        not turned
                        away.</li>
