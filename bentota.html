        <h1>Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h1>
        <p>The Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project was started by Dudley Perera in the year 1981. The main aim of
            the project is to conserve the sea turtles and protect them from predators like birds, dogs, and crabs. It
            is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species. Visitors
            can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here. The
            place is especially suitable for kids but provides to be a once in a lifetime experience for all.</p>

        <p>At a distance of 9 km from Bentota Railway Station, Sea Turtle Hatchery is a turtle conservation center
            located along the coast of the Indian Ocean at Kosgoda. It is one of the must-visit places in Bentota during
            your Sri Lanka Tour.The volunteers patrol the beach at night to make sure that any mother turtles have
            proper
            conditions to lay eggs. They also carry the eggs back to the hatchery to make sure they hatch properly
            without
            any harm from predators and then release the baby sea turtles back into the ocean once properly hatched.
            They
            also take care of sea turtles with disabilities and treat the ones who have become weak due to fishing
            activities.

            Tourists will be guided throughout the process of protecting and proper hatching of the sea turtles while
            visiting the hatchery. One can also visit the hatchery in the evening when the baby turtles are released
            into
            the sea as the risk for predators is minimum at this time and get the opportunity to release their baby sea
            turtle into the sea.</p>
