        <h1>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>

        <p>Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests.
            They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills.Today, six out of the
            seven species of sea turtles are endangered. And most of it is because of human exploitation of natural
            resources. Thankfully, this hatchery has taken the onus to protect them.</p>

                <p>Isn't life all about the little things that take up all your heart? Well, it definitely is, for the
                    good folks at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. Here's a welfare center that genuinely cares about these
                    little creatures, even before they're born.<br>Don't forget to ask our staff, if you could
                    experience the rewarding feeling of releasing some of these delicate creatures to the ocean on your
                    visit! The innocent souls come flapping back the first two-three times the wave hits them. But,
                    after that they flap into their homes; the ocean, with so much joy, it fills up your heartThere are
                    18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of the country. Among them, kosgoda turtle hatchery
                    ,started in 1981, is one of the oldest turtle conservation project in Sri Lanka. Functioning as a
                    hatchery, Kosgoda project envisage much more to preserve the turtle life on the shore. too!<br>
